Package: openprescribingR
Title: Load OpenPrescribing data directly into R
Description: Using the (beta) RESTful API and a few lines of R, I can create a small function to download and import OpenPrescribing data directly into RStudio.
    You could still download it onto your desktop directly from the API, but I think that doing this in-studio makes it much easier to update the information.
